# llocker - Applying logic Locking to Various Circuits

## Purpose

This project was intended to familiar myself with RTL, Locking Locking Schemes, and the [OSS Cad Suite](https://github.com/YosysHQ/oss-cad-suite-build)

This project's mains goals where to:

1. Identify some test circuit designs
1. Push those designs as far along the IC lifecycle as possible
1. Apply a variety of logic locking schemes to said designs
1. Explore the artifacts generated by the process to better understand how to quantify intellectual property protection in IC design


## Overview 

The repository contains the results of applying a series of logic locking algorithms to 6 small Verilog circuits:

- kmStLN
- koStln
- kSLn
- wmStLN
- woStLN
- c432 

For each example circuit, we attempted to apply the following algorithms:

- full_lock 
- full_lock_mux 
- lut_lock 
- mux_lock 
- random_lut_lock 
- sfll_flex 
- sfll_hd 
- trll 
- tt_lock
- tt_lock_sen 
- xor_lock
